A native Rust/GPUI client for a [Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) daemon you installed
yourself. It paints the daemon's terminal cells, split panes included, without
running another terminal emulator or wrapping the TUI.

## Install

### macOS with Homebrew

Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and macOS 15 Sequoia or newer, on Apple
Silicon or Intel. The cask installs the signed, notarized universal app.

```sh
brew install penso/tap/herdr-gpui
open -a Herdr
```

`brew install` resolves casks directly, so `--cask` is not required. To update it
later, or to install by its short name, tap once first:

```sh
brew tap penso/tap
brew install herdr-gpui
```

The cask is published from the [tap](https://github.com/penso/homebrew-tap) by the
release workflow. A cask install updates itself through Homebrew: the in-app
updater detects that Homebrew owns the bundle and runs `brew upgrade --cask
herdr-gpui` for you, so Homebrew's records stay correct. If its metadata is stale,
the updater runs `brew update` and retries once. The update panel shows progress
throughout. macOS `.dmg`, experimental Linux packages, and experimental Windows `.zip`s
are also published on [Releases](https://github.com/penso/herdr-gpui/releases).

### Linux packages

Each release publishes x86_64 and ARM64 builds as a `.deb`, an `.rpm`, an Arch
Linux package, and a plain tarball, all containing the same executable. They need
glibc 2.39 or newer (Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 40, current Arch, or later).
Download the file for your architecture from
[Releases](https://github.com/penso/herdr-gpui/releases), then:

```sh
sudo apt install ./Herdr-VERSION-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.deb      # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ./Herdr-VERSION-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.rpm      # Fedora
sudo pacman -U Herdr-VERSION-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.pkg.tar.zst  # Arch Linux
```

The package manager pulls in the runtime libraries, including the Vulkan loader;
a Vulkan driver for your GPU must also be present. Packages are not in any
distribution repository, so they never update themselves: install each new
release the same way. Before a release, CI installs each package on Ubuntu 24.04,
Debian 13 and Fedora 42, and the x86_64 Arch package on Arch Linux, then checks that
the executable finds every library. The ARM64 Arch package targets Arch Linux ARM
and is not install-tested.

On NixOS, or anywhere with Nix, build from source with the repository's flake:

```sh
nix run github:penso/herdr-gpui
# or add it to a configuration: inputs.herdr-gpui.url = "github:penso/herdr-gpui";
# then environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.herdr-gpui.packages.${system}.default ];
```

The flake builds with the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` on x86_64 and
ARM64 Linux. Like the packages, it never updates itself.

### From source

Install Rust/rustup and, on macOS, the Xcode command-line tools. The repository
pins Rust 1.96.1 and GPUI 0.3.6 (the `gpui-pre` snapshot crate); the Rust version
is declared in `rust-toolchain.toml` and mirrored in `mise.toml`, so `mise install`
also provisions it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/penso/herdr-gpui.git
cd herdr-gpui
just run
```

`just run` uses the optimized release build with the QA menu enabled;
`just run-debug` is notably slower with a dense terminal on screen.
Without `just`: `cargo run --locked --release -p herdr-gpui --features qa-menu`.

Install the Herdr daemon separately. The app starts an already-installed local
`herdr server` when the target session is absent, but never installs or upgrades
a daemon. Explicitly confirming session deletion stops that named session first;
closing or removing the GUI leaves daemon sessions and shared Herdr
configuration intact.

### Linux Builds

On Ubuntu 24.04 (x86_64 or ARM64), run `bash scripts/install-linux-deps.sh`
before building. This installs GPUI's X11/Wayland/font development dependencies
and `libasound2-dev` for Rodio/CPAL native audio. CI and release builds use the
same script. Linux binaries require the system ALSA shared library (`libasound2t64`
on Ubuntu 24.04), a configured default audio device, and Vulkan for rendering.
Audio normally routes through the desktop's ALSA plugin configuration; no CLI
audio player is required. Custom notification sounds are MP3 only. See
[notification sounds](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#notification-sounds).

### Windows

Windows is experimental, not a supported platform: CI checks formatting, lints
every target and feature, and runs workspace tests with default and all features
on `windows-2025`, including headless UI and CLI tests. The release workflow also
builds and CLI-tests the optimized executable, but no native window, renderer,
or live daemon has been exercised. Local
connections use the named pipe the Windows daemon binds, and configuration and
state follow its `%APPDATA%` / `%LOCALAPPDATA%` layout. Saved SSH
hosts, in-app updates, saved GitHub credentials, and the avatar disk cache are
unavailable and report that plainly; an authenticated `gh` or `glab` still
provides pull and merge requests. See
[the GUI README](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#windows).

Each release publishes `Herdr-VERSION-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` and
`Herdr-VERSION-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` (native ARM64), each containing
`herdr-gpui.exe` and its license notices. They carry the same checksums,
Sigstore signatures, and build provenance as the other assets, but they are not
Authenticode-signed, so SmartScreen warns on first launch, and they never update
themselves: download each new release manually. The executable is
console-subsystem, so launching it from Explorer also opens a console window.

## How it connects

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph app["Herdr GPUI (this repo)"]
        ui["herdr-gpui<br/>window, painting, input"]
        client["herdr-client<br/>discovery, socket worker, sessions"]
        proto["herdr-protocol<br/>framing, surface patches"]
        ui --> client --> proto
    end

    proto <-->|"bincode frames over<br/>herdr-client.sock"| daemon

    subgraph host["Your machine or a saved SSH host"]
        daemon["herdr daemon"]
        daemon --> terms["terminal processes,<br/>workspaces, agents"]
    end
```

The daemon owns the terminals and all session state. The GUI attaches to the
binary **client** socket, renders the surfaces it is sent, and sends semantic
input back. Closing or detaching the GUI leaves the daemon and its terminals
running.

Pull requests come from GitHub through the app's own device sign-in, or
through the `gh` or `glab` CLI you have already signed in; GitLab merge
requests use `glab`. The CLI keeps its credential, and the app never reads it.
See [Using your own gh and glab](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#using-your-own-gh-and-glab).

[Browser tabs](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#browser-tabs) are the exception:
Herdr has no browser panes, so web pages shown beside a workspace's terminals
belong to the GUI alone. Agents in your panes open them with
`herdr-gpui browser open URL`, which reaches the running app over a local
socket of its own. The [review panel](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#review-panel)
is the GUI's too: it runs Git against the focused local checkout, shows the
changed files and their diffs, and sends your comments on them to an agent's
pane.

## Audio Test

The QA menu is excluded from default Cargo builds, including published releases.
`just run` enables it automatically; with Cargo, use
`cargo run --locked --release -p herdr-gpui --features qa-menu`.
To manually test native audio in that build, choose **QA > Play Sound**. It plays the built-in
Done sound on the background Rodio worker, even without a daemon or active pane
and even with notifications muted. `HERDR_DISABLE_SOUND` and `NEXTEST` still
suppress playback. See [notification sounds](crates/herdr-gpui/README.md#notification-sounds)
for queue limits and playback details.

## Performance

`just test-perf` opens a daemon-free native fixture with a dense 160x50 terminal,
40 workspaces, and 40 agents. It dispatches real window-local mouse/scroll events
and measures cold frames, warm hover, and both sidebar lists' scrolling. It also
asserts that unchanged terminal cells need zero new text-shaping calls, validates
batched background counts, and compares cached glyphs with freshly shaped ones.

On the development M4 Max, caching and background batching reduced release hover
p95 from about 51 ms to 12 ms, and scrolling from 56 ms to 14 ms. The benchmark
measures CPU event-to-scene construction, not GPU completion or pointer-to-screen
latency. Use `just test-perf 50` to set a different calibrated budget; native tests
remain opt-in rather than imposing machine-dependent timings on hosted CI.

See [PERFORMANCE.md](crates/herdr-gpui/PERFORMANCE.md) for the before/after results,
reference mode, workload, deterministic checks, and remaining limitations.
